## 📂 Assignment Description
This repository contains Java implementations of core **Data Structures and Algorithms**, implemented **from scratch** without using Java built-in collections, as per lab instructions.

All programs:
- Are written in **Java**
- Implement data structures manually
- Call all functions from the `main()` method
- Follow proper time complexity requirements
